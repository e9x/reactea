Essential features that enable React to work correctly, such as:

- JS (TypeScript checking, ESLint)
- CSS (including modules)
- HTML (page generation)
- SVG (Including SVGs as components and URLs)
- Images (Inline image URIs)

The default export will return a config that includes all of the above, however you can create your own config using these features. All of the above are provided as exports.
